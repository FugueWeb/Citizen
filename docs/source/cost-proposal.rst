Cost Proposal
#############

All Offerors must submit a cost proposal via https://sbir2.st.dhs.gov. Proposed costs must not exceed the maximum thresholds outlined below.

For additional information on the items in the Cost Proposal, reference the DHS SBIR Cost Proposal Guide at https://sbir2.st.dhs.gov under “Resources.”

Additionally, more information about cost proposals and accounting standards can be found in the DCAA publication, Information for Contractors, available at www.dcaa.mil/dcaam_7641.90.pdf.

Proposals submitted under this Solicitation will be considered valid for 90 days. If a proposal is selected for award, Offerors should be prepared to submit further cost/pricing documentation to the Contracting Officer in order to justify items on the cost proposal.

For Phase I planning purposes, Offerors should budget for two mandatory trips to Washington, DC – a post‐award kick‐off meeting and a one‐day meeting to present the results in the final report. The structure of the kick‐off meeting is different for S&T and DNDO topics. Refer to the table below for details:
