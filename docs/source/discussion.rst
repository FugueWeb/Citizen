Unresolved Issues and Gaps
**************************

The data as presented does not consider non-OECD member states. Moreover, the data set does not assess the opinion of those surveyed over the course of time. Tracking student learning growths, and the perceptions associated with these growths, should be considered and not just seeing where students are at any point in time. Furthermore, the data does not measure the knowledge and skills of people directly, therefore it does not test whether literacy can be applied in novel situations.

Research Strategy
*****************

Integration cross-analysis with the exisiting corpus of data devrived from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) should be a priority, as well as expansion of the data set to account for more countries, notably developing nations. Additionally, the study should expand to incorporate lower/younger grades so as to determine the progress that is being made in education raising quality. The humanistic perspective should also be a priority for evaluating educational results, and evaluation should take place in a framework of multiple kinds of perspectives. Looking at test data from students is one perspective. Looking at teachers views on student performance would be another.
