*************************************************************
Identification and Significance of the Problem or Opportunity
*************************************************************

Succinctly define the specific technical problem or opportunity addressed; the proposed innovation; the relevance and significance of the proposed innovation to a need(s) within the topic description; the proposed innovation relative to the state of the art; and the importance of the work proposed.

********************
Technical Objectives
********************

tate the specific objectives of the Phase I R/R&D effort, including the technical questions that must be answered to determine the feasibility of the proposed innovation/approach.

*********
Work Plan
*********

(including the efforts of the subcontractor(s)/consultant(s), if applicable) – Provide an explicit, detailed description of the Phase I approach. The Plan must indicate what tasks are planned, how, when, and where the work will be conducted, a schedule of major events, and the final product(s) to be delivered. The Phase I effort must determine the technical feasibility of the proposed concept, and address the questions cited in the Technical Objectives immediately above. The methods planned to achieve each objective or task must be discussed explicitly and in detail. Task descriptions, schedules, resource allocations, estimated task hours for each key personnel and planned accomplishments, including project milestones, must be included. This section will be a substantial portion of the total Technical Proposal.

*******************************************
Related Research / Research and Development
*******************************************

Describe significant (current and/or previous) R/R&D activities that are directly related to the proposed effort, including any conducted by the principal investigator, the Offeror, consultants, or others. Discuss any planned coordination with outside sources. Describe how these activities relate to the proposed project. Describe previous efforts similar but directly related to the proposed effort. For each effort, provide the following: (a) short description, (b) client for which work was performed (including individual to be contacted and phone number), and (c) date of completion. The Offeror must persuade reviewers of his or her awareness of key, recent R/R&D conducted by others in the specific topic area.

*********************************************************
Key Individuals and Bibliography of Directly Related Work
*********************************************************

Identify key personnel who will be involved in the effort including information on directly related education, experience, and bibliographic information. A concise resume for the Principal Investigator and all key personnel, including a list of relevant publications (if any), must be included. All resumes will count toward the appropriate page limitation, see Section 3.1. Offerors must identify any non‐U.S. citizen(s) expected to be involved on proposed project [including direct employees, subcontractors and consultants], their country of origin, type of visa or work permit under which they are performing, and an explanation of their anticipated level of involvement on this project. Do not include Privacy Act Information.

************************************************************
Relationship with Future Research / Research and Development
************************************************************

State the anticipated results of the proposed approach if the project is successful through Phase I and Phase II. Discuss the significance of the Phase I effort in providing a foundation for Phase II research or research and development effort, application and commercialization efforts (Phase III).

**************************
Commercialization Strategy
**************************

(1) Explicitly describe the company's strategy (vision) for commercializing the proposed technology and how it will transition to the specific operational component in DHS, other Federal Agencies, and/or private sector markets. (2) Provide specific information on what related technologies, if any, already exist in the market and why the technology being proposed will be superior and how this information was ascertained. (3) Include a discussion on the Offeror’s current capability to commercialize previously developed technologies, as well as how the Offeror intends to develop the proposed technology all the way to the market. Responses to (1), (2), and (3) must be specific to the technology being proposed. Failure to respond to any of the items listed will result in a lower valuation for criterion c (See Section 4.1 for Phase I evaluation criteria). If the Offeror has no commercial experience (item (3)) this should clearly be stated and Offeror should describe how Offeror intends to bring the necessary experience to the company.

**************************
Facilitities and Equipment
**************************

Provide information to allow the evaluators to assess the ability of the Offeror to carry out the activities of the proposed phase as well as all subsequent phases. Describe available instrumentation and physical facilities necessary to carry out the proposed effort. Equipment to be purchased, as detailed in the Cost Proposal, must be justified under this section. Also state whether or not the facilities where the proposed work will be performed meet environmental laws and regulations of federal, state, and local governments for, but not limited to, the following groupings: airborne emissions, waterborne effluents, external radiation levels, outdoor noise, solid and bulk waste disposal practices, and handling and storage of toxic and hazardous materials.

******************************
Subcontractors and Consultants
******************************

Involvement of any subcontractor(s) or consultant(s) (including Federal Laboratories, FFRDCs, universities, and technical assistance providers) is permitted. If such involvement is proposed, it must be described in detail in this section and also in the Cost Proposal. Subcontractors’ or consultants’ involvement under Discretionary Technical Assistance (see Section 5.11) must be clearly delineated from involvement by other subcontractors and consultants. A minimum of two‐thirds (66%) of the research and/or analytical work in Phase I, as measured by total contract value, must be carried out by the proposing small business concern. A minimum of one‐half (50%) of the research and/or analytical work in Phase II, as measured by total contract value, must be carried out by the proposing small business concern.

If the small business determines that it needs to acquire services from a non‐U.S. source, it must fully explain in its proposal why a non‐U.S. source must be used, and why no qualified U.S. source exists to perform the same services.

***************************
Potential Post Applications
***************************

Briefly describe the following: (1) whether and by what means the proposed project appears to have potential commercial application; and (2) whether and by what means the proposed project appears to have potential use by the Federal Government.

*****************************************************************
Prior, Current, or Pending Support of Similar Proposals or Awards
*****************************************************************

WARNING – While it is permissible, with proposal notification, to submit identical proposals or proposals containing a significant amount of essentially equivalent work (see Appendix B) for consideration under numerous Federal program solicitations, it is unlawful to enter into funding agreements (contracts or grants) requiring essentially equivalent effort. If there is any question concerning this, it must be disclosed to the soliciting agency or agencies before award.

If an Offeror elects to submit identical proposals or proposals containing a significant amount of essentially equivalent work in response to this Solicitation, or other Federal program solicitations, or is substantially the same as another proposal that has been funded, is now being funded, will be submitted to other agencies for funding consideration, or is pending with DHS or another Federal Agency, the Offeror must indicate so on the Proposal Cover Sheet and provide the following information in the Technical Proposal:

a. Name and address of the Federal Agency(s) to which a proposal was submitted, will be submitted, or from which an award is expected or has been received.
b. Date of proposal submission or date of award
c. Title of proposal
d. Name and title of principal investigator or project manager for each proposal submitted or award received
e. Title, number, and date of solicitation(s) under which the proposal was submitted, will be submitted, or under which award is expected or has been received
f. If award was received, state contract number
g. Specify the applicable topics for each SBIR Proposal submitted or award received

Note: If this section does not apply, the following statement should be included in the Technical Proposal: "No prior, current, or pending support for proposed work."
