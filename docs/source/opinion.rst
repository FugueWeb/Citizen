Given that opportunities are unequally distributed, the data raises the frequently discussed question of equity. To ensure people from different social backgrounds have equal chances, one of the most important lessons from this comparison is that we do not have to compromise equity to achieve excellence. Because spending per student usually only accounts for 20% [#f1]_ of performance variation among countries, two countries with similar spending achieve different results. Thus, the data suggest that we no longer live in a world divided between poor and badly-educated countries, and rich and well-educated ones.

Data is a powerful tool that can direct the flow of the administrative finance and subsidies that run the education systems. It can help countries to set meaningful targets in terms of measurable goals achieved by the world's leaders. In a global economy, it is no longer national improvement that's the benchmark for the best overall performing education systems internationally. Measuring how much time people spend in school or what degree they have is not necessarily the best way of recognizing what they actually believe. In that respect, better degrees do not automatically translate into better skills and better jobs and better lives, making the over-arching goal to be the achievement of high average performance and high social equity.
